        I have worked with both the National Park and U.S. Fish and Wildlife
        services, as well as local parks departments, giving back to nature as
        my goal. I am now expanding the ways I can give back by exploring the
        confluence of programming, user experience, and positive intentions. I
        intend to help to people and planet alike.
