        <p>
          Welcome. I am a front end web developer with a specialty in ReactJS,
          alongside skills in TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, Vanilla CSS,
          automated testing, and API development with Ruby on Rails. Additional
          skills may be viewed under Stack(s).
        </p>
        <p>
          I bring experience collaborating on highly motivated teams that are dedicated
          to solving problems and delivering quality. I once designed and
          enhanced aesthetics of highly-visible outdoor public spaces, and have
          carried my design pallet with me as I create visually-pleasing and
          exciting user interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thoroughly enjoy coding, building both front end and full stack
          web applications, and continually explore the confluence of
          programming, user experience, and positive intentions.
        </p>
        <p>Come have a look at my projects, and get in touch!</p>
