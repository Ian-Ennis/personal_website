          Welcome. I am front end web developer with a specialty in ReactJS,
          alongside skills in TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, Vanilla CSS,
          automated testing with Jest and React Testing Library, and back end
          integration with Ruby on Rails. Additional skills may be viewed under
          Stack(s).

        <p>
          I once designed and enhanced aesthetics of highly-visible outdoor
          spaces in both rural and urban parks for the benefit of the general
          public. What once was my pallet within landscape design has evolved
          into a pallet of front end design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I bring experience collaborating on teams who are highly motivated to
          solve problems and continually deliver quality to others. I'm driven
          to explore the confluence of programming, positive intentions, and
          user experience. By creating intuitive and enjoyable user interfaces,
          I may continue to give back to those around me. Come check out my
          work.
