          Welcome. I am a front end web developer with a specialty in ReactJS,
          alongside skills in TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML and Vanilla CSS,
          automated testing, and API development with Ruby on Rails. Additional
          skills may be viewed under Stack(s).

          I once designed and enhanced aesthetics of highly-visible outdoor
          public spaces, and have brought my landscape design pallet
          along for the journey as I create visually-pleasing and exciting user
          interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm driven to explore the confluence of programming, positive
          intentions, and user experience. I bring experience collaborating on
          teams who are highly motivated to solve problems and deliver quality.
          My goal is to continually give back to others through programming.
          Come check out my work.
