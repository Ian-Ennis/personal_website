          Welcome. I am front end web developer with a specialty in ReactJS,
          alongside strong and knowledgable skills in JavaScript, HTML5, Vanilla
          CSS, testing with Jest and React Testing Library, and Ruby on Rails.
          Additional skills may be viewed under Stack(s).

          I once designed and enhanced aesthetics of outdoor spaces in both
          rural and urban parks for the benefit of the general public, and bring
          experience collaborating with teams of people who are
          similarly driven to deliver quality to
          others. What once was a pallet within garden design has become a
          pallet of front end design.

          I thoroughly enjoy exploring the confluence of programming, user
          experience, and positive intentions. Through creating intuitive and
          enjoyable user interfaces, I can continue to
          give back to my users. Come check out my work.
