          Welcome. I am front end web developer with a specialty in ReactJS,
          alongside skills in TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML5, Vanilla CSS,
          automated testing with Jest and React Testing Library, and back end integration
          Ruby on Rails. Additional skills may be viewed under Stack(s).

          I once designed and enhanced aesthetics of outdoor spaces in both
          rural and urban parks for the benefit of the general public. What once
          was my pallet within landscape design has evolved into a pallet of front end
          design. I bring experience collaborating with teams of people who are
          similarly driven to deliver quality to other people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy exploring the confluence of programming, positive intentions,
          and user experience. Through creating intuitive and enjoyable user
          interfaces, I can continue to give back others. Come check out my
          work.
